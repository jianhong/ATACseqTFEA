Description: Assay for Transpose-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing
    (ATAC-seq) is a technique to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility
    by probing open chromatin with hyperactive mutant Tn5 Transposase that
    inserts sequencing adapters into open regions of the genome.
    ATACseqTFEA is an improvement of the current computational method that
    detects differential activity of transcription factors (TFs).
    ATACseqTFEA not only uses the difference of open region information,
    but also (or emphasizes) the difference of TFs
    footprints (cutting sites or insertion sites).
    ATACseqTFEA provides an easy, rigorous way to broadly assess TF
    activity changes between two conditions.
